# Changelog

## [0.8] - 2026-03-10

### ✨ New Features & Languages
-   **Multi-language Expansion**: Added full localization for **Arabic (AR)**, **Russian (RU)**, **Chinese (ZH)**, and **Japanese (JA)**.
-   **Training Mode Selector**: Refactored the "Entraînement" tab to use a dropdown for Training Mode (Gsplat, ML Sharp, 360 Extractor, 4DGS) instead of generic radio buttons, adapting the UI dynamically for each mode.
-   **GSplat Source Type**: Re-added an explicit "Images / Video" selector specifically when Gsplat mode is chosen, to correctly inform the underlying pipeline.

### 🛠 Improvements
-   **UI Cleanup**: Removed outdated source checkboxes in favor of the unified mode selector.
-   **Localization UI**: Displayed languages in their own native scripts in the language selector.

## [0.75] - 2026-03-03

### 🛠 Bug Fixes (Critical)
-   **`engine.py`**: Added missing `from .i18n import tr` import — without it, any cancellation or error during COLMAP processing would crash with a `NameError`.
-   **`four_dgs_engine.py`**: Removed broken `log()` override that called the non-existent `self.logger` attribute (correct name is `self.logger_callback` inherited from `BaseEngine`). Also removed a redundant `stop()` override.
-   **`brush_engine.py`**: Added missing `import signal` — `signal.SIGTERM` was used in `stop()` without being imported, causing a `NameError` on process termination.
-   **`engine.py`**: Removed an unreachable `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` block that appeared after a `return True` statement and was never executed.
-   **`workers.py` — `Extractor360Worker`**: Added missing `__init__` method. The class referenced `self.engine`, `self.input_path`, `self.output_path`, and `self.params` but never assigned them, causing an immediate `AttributeError` on use.
-   **`workers.py` — `FourDGSWorker`**: Fixed `stop()` which wrote to `self._is_running` (wrong attribute, never read) instead of calling `super().stop()` to properly signal thread interruption.

### 🛡 Security
-   **`superplat_engine.py`**: Fixed CORS origin validation — the previous `"localhost" in origin` substring check could be bypassed by a crafted hostname like `evil.localhost.com`. Replaced with strict `urlparse().hostname` comparison.
-   **`extractor_360_engine.py`**: Replaced `env["PYTHONPATH"] = ""` (which broke the subprocess's module resolution) with `env.pop("PYTHONPATH", None)` for clean isolation.
-   **`base_engine.py`**: Narrowed bare `except:` in `is_safe_path()` to `except (TypeError, ValueError, OSError)`.

### ⚡ Apple Silicon Optimization
-   **`system.py` — `get_optimal_threads()`**: Now queries `sysctl hw.perflevel0.logicalcpu` to retrieve the actual **P-core count** on Apple Silicon (e.g. 4 on M1/M2). Previously used an 80% heuristic of total cores, which inadvertently scheduled compute-heavy tasks (COLMAP, ffmpeg) on efficiency cores.

### 🏗 Refactoring & Code Quality
-   **`base_engine.py`**: Extracted shared `_kill_process(process)` helper — consolidates three identical `os.killpg` / `signal.SIGTERM` implementations previously duplicated in `brush_engine`, `superplat_engine`, and `sharp_engine`.
-   **`engine.py`**: Replaced 3× `rglob(ext)` calls (three separate filesystem traversals) with a single `rglob('*')` + `suffix.lower()` filter. Also fixes case-insensitive matching for `.JPG`/`.PNG` extensions. `_IMAGE_EXTS` promoted to module-level constant.
-   **`four_dgs_engine.py`**: Replaced `readline()` while-loop with cleaner `for line in process.stdout:` iteration.
-   **`config_tab.py`**: Removed duplicate `quitRequested = pyqtSignal()` signal definition.
-   **`extractor_360_engine.py`**: Narrowed bare `except:` to `except (ValueError, IndexError)` in progress parsing.

## [0.74] - 2026-03-01

### ✨ Installation & Stability
-   **Brush Engine Optimization**: 
    -   **Native Binaries**: The dependency installer now downloads the official, pre-compiled `v0.3.0` release binaries of Brush for macOS (Apple Silicon), Windows, and Linux rather than building from source. This entirely bypasses the Rust toolchain requirements and typical `cargo` compilation errors.
    -   **Fail-safe Compilation**: If the binary download fails or the platform is unsupported, the `cargo install` fallback is now strictly pinned to tag `v0.3.0` with `--locked` dependencies, preventing build breakages caused by upstream library updates (like the previous `naga` crate issue).

## [0.73] - 2026-02-18

### ✨ New Features
-   **Auto-Update**: Added support for automatic updates of engines (starting with Glomap) via `config.json` (`glomap_auto_update: true`).
-   **Interactive Updates**: Improved update flow to ask the user for confirmation when auto-update is disabled, ensuring no silent failures or skipped updates.

### 🛠 Fixes
-   **Glomap Build**: Fixed CMakeCache errors by automatically cleaning the `build` directory before recompiling.
-   **SuperSplat Update**: Fixed git conflicts (package-lock.json) by forcing a reset before pulling updates.
-   **Dependency Script**: Corrected configuration loading for nested `config` keys.

## [0.72] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Multi-language Support**: Extensive localization for **German (DE)**, **Italian (IT)**, and **Spanish (ES)**.
- **Enhanced Translation Engine**: ~1140 total translation keys across all 5 supported languages (FR, EN, DE, IT, ES).
- **UI Localization**: Integrated new language options in the Config tab for real-time switching.

## [v0.71] - 2026-02-07

### ✨ Stability & UX Improvements
- **360 Extraction Workflow**: Implemented recursive image search and automatic AI mask filtering (*.mask.png), resolving the "0 images found" issue.
- **English Startup Experience**: fully translated `run.command` and `setup_dependencies.py` for a consistent first-launch experience.
- **Detailed Component Audit**: Each engine (Sharp, Brush, Glomap, etc.) now reports its individual status (Ready/Missing/Update) during startup with visual markers.
- **UI Visual Hierarchy**: Secondary/Utility tabs now use muted gray coloring to help users focus on the core photogrammetry workflow.
- **Sharp Path Handling**: Hardened absolute path resolution to allow using system folders like the Desktop for output without permission errors.

### 🛠 Bug Fixes
- Fixed missing `shutil` import in the core engine.
- Fixed `TypeError` in command logging for several engines.
- Repaired broken environments for Sharp and 360Extractor after refactor.

    -   Standardized the `retranslate_ui` pattern across the entire application interface.
    -   Centralized all user-facing strings in `i18n.py` for easier future translations.

### 🏗 Architecture & Cleanup
-   **Unified Engine Core**: Consistently using `BaseEngine` across all modules (`Colmap`, `Brush`, `Sharp`, `360`, `4DGS`, `Upscale`, `SuperSplat`).
-   **Worker Refactoring**: Simplified UI workers by offloading command logic to the core engine layer.
-   **Code Hardening**: Improved error handling and path validation in the base engine classes.

### 🛠 Improvements & Fixes
-   **Sync**: Fixed missing or duplicated translation keys in `i18n.py`.

### Added
-   **Auto Update Check**: The launcher (`run.command`) now checks for new versions on startup and prompts the user to update.

### Fixed
-   **Dataset Deletion Safety**: Fixed a critical bug where "Delete Dataset" would remove the entire output folder. It now correctly targets the project subdirectory and only deletes its content, preserving the folder structure.

## [v0.18] - 2026-01-07

### Added
-   **Project Workflow**: New "Project Name" field. The application now organizes outputs into a structured project folder (`[Output]/[ProjectName]`) containing `images`, `sparse`, and `checkpoints`.
-   **Auto-Copy Images**: When using a folder of images as input, they are now automatically copied into the project's `columns` directory, ensuring the project is self-contained.
-   **Session Persistence**: The application now saves your settings (paths, parameters, window state) on exit and restores them on the next launch.
-   **Brush Output**: Brush training now correctly targets the project's `checkpoints` directory.

    -   Added specific "Manual Mode" toggle defaulting to "New Training".
-   **UX Improvements**: Reordered tabs (Sharp after SuperSplat), fixed Max Resolution UI, and improved translations.

## [v0.16] - 2026-01-05

### Added
-   **Glomap Integration**: Added support for [Glomap](https://github.com/colmap/glomap) as an alternative Structure-from-Motion (SfM) mapper.
    -   New parameter `--use_glomap` in CLI and "Utiliser Glomap" checkbox in GUI.
    -   Automatic installation checking at startup.
    -   Support for compiling Glomap from source (requires Xcode/Homebrew).

### Changed
-   **Dependency Management**: Refactored `setup_dependencies.py` to improve maintainability and reduce code duplication.
-   **Startup Flow**: The application now intelligently checks for missing engines or updates for all components (Brush, Sharp, SuperSplat, Glomap) at launch.

### Fixed
-   Fixed macOS compilation issues for Glomap by explicitly detecting and linking `libomp` (OpenMP) via Homebrew.

## [v0.15]
-   Initial support for Brush, Sharp, and SuperSplat integration.
